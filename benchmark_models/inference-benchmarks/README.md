Set of benchmarks for BN inference.

For each model, there is a large parametrized variant for benchmark, a fixed variant for result check, and steady state data. Possibly, there are also additional variants/files.

Most of the models are obtained from [biodivine-boolean-models](https://github.com/sybila/biodivine-boolean-models), some for example from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab825), or [this paper](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2018.00039).
