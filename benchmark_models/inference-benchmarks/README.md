Set of benchmark models and data for BN inference through coloured model checking.

For each model, there is a large parametrized variant for benchmark, a fixed variant for result check, attractor state data, and results. Possibly, there are also additional variants/files.

Most of the models are obtained from our repository [biodivine-boolean-models](https://github.com/sybila/biodivine-boolean-models), IDs corresponds to the ones used in that repository.
Model and data regarding arabidopsis case study comes from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2018.00039). 
Similarly, the CNS development model and data is introduced in [this article](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2019.00014) 
and TLGL model and data from [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002267).
